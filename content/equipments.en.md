One of the most important in image processing research is computer resources, that is, computers. A high-performance computer is indispensable for analyzing images and extracting important information.  
Our laboratory has many computers with powerful computing capabilities, so you can live a comfortable research life.

> ## Personal Computer  

TStudents in our laboratory are provided with powerful computers. The supplied computer can be used freely by one student and can perform various experiments at any time.  
Here are some of the personal computers.

> ## Server

In order to satisfy the greed that even personal computers seem to be unsatisfactory, we have a computer server. If you use a server, you can experiment more powerful than a personal computer.  
Here we introduce all the servers owned by our laboratory.  

### GPU Server

### CPU Server

{{<facillity_list src="/static/csv/equipments/cpu_server.csv">}}  

### File Server

> ## Otherwise

Not only GPU server but also powerful CPU server and file server are prepared.

- 30Core 3TB RAM CPU server

- 100TB file server

etc...
