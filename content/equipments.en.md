<span style="font-size: 120%">
High-performance computers are highly required for analyzing high dimensional medical images.  
Our laboratory has a plenty of computers with large memories, powerful CPUs and/or GPUs.  
Students can use desktop computers provided from our lab as well as server machines for large scale computation.

> ## Personal Computer  

The students in our laboratory are provided with powerful computers. The supplied computer can be used freely by one student and can perform various experiments at any time.  
Here are some of the personal computers.

> ## Server

In order to satisfy the greed that even personal computers seem to be unsatisfactory, we have a computer server. If you use a server, you can experiment more powerful than a personal computer.  
Here we introduce all the servers owned by our laboratory.
